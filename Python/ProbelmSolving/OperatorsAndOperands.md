# What are Operators and Operands
In programming, operators are special symbols or keywords that are used to perform operations on variables and values. Operands are the values or variables on which the operators act.

## Types of Operators

### Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` : Multiplication
- `/` : Division
- `%` : Modulus (remainder)
- `**` : Exponentiation
- `//` : Floor division

### Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They return either `True` or `False`.

- `==` : Equal to
- `!=` : Not equal to
- `>` : Greater than
- `<` : Less than
- `>=` : Greater than or equal to
- `<=` : Less than or equal to

### Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

- `and` : Returns `True` if both statements are true
- `or` : Returns `True` if one of the statements is true
- `not` : Reverses the result, returns `False` if the result is true

### Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

- `=` : Assign
- `+=` : Add and assign
- `-=` : Subtract and assign
- `*=` : Multiply and assign
- `/=` : Divide and assign
- `%=` : Modulus and assign
- `**=` : Exponentiation and assign
- `//=` : Floor division and assign

### Identity Operators
Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects.

- `is` : Returns `True` if both variables are the same object
- `is not` : Returns `True` if both variables are not the same object

### Membership Operators
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object.

- `in` : Returns `True` if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
- `not in` : Returns `True` if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object

### Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are used to perform bit-level operations.

- `&` : AND
- `|` : OR
- `^` : XOR
- `~` : NOT
- `<<` : Zero fill left shift
- `>>` : Signed right shift

Understanding these operators and how they interact with operands is fundamental to writing effective and efficient code.
